# Automate the initial creation and update of a mirror in aptly.
# Uncomment a prepared section or use your own.

# For any section you select, you need to install repo signing public
# key, if you wanna take it from your system you can look for in:
# /usr/share/keyrings/ (like /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg) or you can take it from apt-key (apt-key help / list / export).
# Export the key to the pubring in GPG utility (ususaly /root/.gnupg/pubring.gpg). You can use prepared script /opt/keys_imp.sh for it.

# The variables (as set below) will create a mirror of the Ubuntu Trusty repo
# with the main & universe components, you can add other components like restricted
# multiverse etc by adding to the array (separated by spaces).

# The variables (as set below) will create a mirror of the Debian Buster repo
# with the main and update components. If you do mirror these, you'll want to
# include "deb http://security.debian.org buster/updates main" in your sources.list
# file or mirror it similarly as done below to keep up with security updates.
